# flask-docker-mysql-minio-scaffold

This project implements a full-stack web application combining Flask, MySQL, and MinIO in a Docker Compose stack.

The application itself does almost nothing. This is really about seeing how multiple applications can be combined using Docker, and also to provide an application scaffolding that can be modified to use with real applications.
